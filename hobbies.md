## Hobbies

These are the interests that sit alongside my engineering life: routines and creative outlets that keep me curious, balanced, and constantly learning in different ways.

## Friends & Society
I've had many friends over my time in university. Some have been close friends, others more casual acquaintances. I've taken more initiative to meet more people and build friendships since starting uni. I've joined various clubs and societies to meet like-minded individuals and expand my social circle and cultural understanding. Some that have a love for food such as the Food Adventure Society, Multiracial Intercultural Experience Society (MIXSOC) for understanding and celebrating differences in others cultures, Sri Lankan Society (SLSOC) for learning more on my own heritage, and Sydney University Association of Biomedical Engineering (SUABE) for my professional life.
<br><br>
I've also taken up leadership roles to help organise events and activities for members, further adding to my leadership skills. This was officially recognised by the university when I received an award from the Pro Vice Chancellor for Outstanding Service Award in 2021. I've also been involved as a residential assistant (RA) in my residential college (Regiment Building) to help with event planning and supporting new and existing students with their student life.

## Gym
I’ve been going to the gym since around 2022 to improve both my physical and mental health, and over time it has significantly transformed my physical appearance. It has since become a regular part of my routine. While I previously trained four to five times a week, I’ve recently scaled back to two to three sessions per week to prioritise recovery and make time for other hobbies.

## Arts & Crafts
I’ve been interested in this since Years 11 and 12, when I studied Design and Technology, as well as Metalwork and Woodwork as consecutive elective subjects in high school. During this time, I worked on a range of hands-on projects involving laser cutting, metalworking (including annealing, casting, and welding), Japanese wood joints, and 3D printing.
<br><br>
Since then, I’ve explored more accessible forms of arts and crafts, such as polymer clay and 3D origami. However, I still enjoy 3D printing and laser cutting, particularly given my access to these tools at university. These skills also occasionally prove useful in my engineering projects.

## Cooking & Baking
I've gotten into this art since I left home for university. I struggled with it initially but now I quite enjoy cooking and baking in my free time. It's a great way to unwind and also a very useful skill to have. With cooking I've found its very much a more forgiving task compared to baking which is more a science that I'm still learning more about with its interaction in certain ingredients. I've also gotten some interest in coffee brewing and latte art since buying a coffee machine.

## Vinyl & Music
I’ve recently started collecting vinyl records as a more intentional way to engage with music. I like the physicality of records: the cover art, the ritual, the presence they add to a room, and how they let me show a bit more of who I am through my space. I keep my record player ready so I can listen anytime, which makes the collection feel lived-in rather than purely decorative.

## Photography
I’ve loved photography ever since I was a kid, often experimenting with editing techniques to enhance the beauty of certain images. This included long-exposure shots, such as writing with sparklers, as well as various forms of light manipulation.
<br><br>
Since then, I’ve invested in both a film camera and a digital camera to continue practising and to better align with my personal aesthetic. I’ve found that I’m particularly drawn to early-2000s-style photography, characterised by subtle grain and warm tones, with a strong emphasis on composition and lighting.
