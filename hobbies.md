> My hobbies reflect a balance between discipline, creativity, and hands-on making. Many of them naturally overlap with my engineering mindset — exploring ideas, working with materials, and turning concepts into tangible outcomes.

# Hobbies

## Gym & Fitness
Training at the gym is a regular part of my routine. Beyond physical health, it helps build consistency, mental resilience, and focus. It’s also my main way of resetting after long study or work days, keeping me grounded and motivated.

## Music & Vinyl Collecting
I enjoy listening to music and collecting vinyl records. Vinyl has pushed me to be more intentional about how I listen — appreciating albums as complete works rather than background noise. Music plays a big role in how I concentrate, relax, and stay creative.

### Vinyl Collection

## Arts, Crafts & Making
I enjoy working on creative, hands-on projects across a range of mediums, including:
- Polymer clay and small-scale sculpting  
- Graphic design and digital layout work  
- 3D origami and structured paper crafts  
- Laser cutting for precise, repeatable designs  
- 3D printing for prototyping and functional objects  

### Prints, Designs & Builds

## Creative–Technical Crossover
What I enjoy most is the intersection between creativity and engineering — combining design thinking with technical tools. Whether it’s designing a part for 3D printing or creating something purely artistic, I like understanding both the **why** and the **how** behind what I make.
