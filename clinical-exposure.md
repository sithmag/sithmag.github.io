title: Clinical & Hospital Exposure
---

A short record of my early clinical exposure in both **Sri Lanka** and **Australia**, and how it shaped my interest in **healthcare engineering**, **patient-centred design**, and the real-world constraints that influence clinical outcomes.
<br><br>
Rather than presenting these experiences as “clinical training”, I include them as formative context, they helped me understand how hospital systems operate, how resource constraints change decision-making, and why health technology needs to be designed for the environments it will actually be used in.

## Teaching Hospital Karapitiya — Oncology Unit  
**Karapitiya, Sri Lanka** · **Jan 2020**

Completed a supervised secondary student work experience placement within the **Oncology Unit**, gaining early exposure to clinical environments in a high-acuity public hospital setting.
<br><br>
**What I did / observed**
- Completed **38 hours of supervised observation** across ward rounds, clinics, and theatre sessions  
- Observed oncological procedures and multidisciplinary cancer care pathways  
- Assisted with basic ward administrative tasks and patient-flow support  
- Gained exposure to endoscopy and diagnostic workflows  
- Built early awareness of ethics, privacy, and patient dignity within healthcare delivery

<br><br>
**What I did / observed**
- Completed **24 hours of supervised hospital observation** across multiple departments  
- Shadowed nurses and administrative staff to understand ward operations  
- Observed basic clinical procedures and hospital workflows  
- Gained early exposure to the Australian public healthcare system

### Key Learnings from Clinical Exposure

- **Quality of life care extends beyond clinical decisions**
  This highlighted the role of biomedical engineering for me in designing technologies that prioritise usability, comfort, and patient dignity, not just technical performance.

- **Resource constraints fundamentally shape healthcare delivery**
  This reinforced my idea around the importance of engineering solutions that are cost-effective, robust, and adaptable, particularly in settings where ideal infrastructure or equipment is unavailable.

- **Strong workflows and coordination sustain outcomes under pressure**  
  This demonstrated how biomedical engineering solutions must integrate seamlessly into existing clinical workflows, supporting clinicians rather than adding complexity or burden.
