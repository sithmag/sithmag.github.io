# About Me

<img src="/images/sithmafloat.jpg" class="floatpic">
<br />
Hi I'm **Sithma Gunawardena!** <br>

<br />
I am a final-year Biomedical Engineering (Honours) student at the University of Sydney, specialising in nanoscale biotechnology, with an expected graduation in July 2026. My work sits at the intersection of biomaterials, medical device design, electrochemical diagnostics, and biomedical instrumentation, with a strong focus on translating engineering concepts into practical, patient-centred solutions. I also have a strong interest in the electrical and electronics components of biomedical engineering, particularly sensors, circuits, signal processing, embedded systems, and how hardware decisions shape real clinical performance.

<br />
Over the course of my studies, I have led and contributed to multiple multidisciplinary projects across assistive technology, diagnostics, and health-tech innovation. This includes leading a customised seating solution project for individuals with Cerebral Palsy in collaboration with Jacaranda Flame Consulting and the Cerebral Palsy Alliance (CPA) covering biomaterials research (foam, hydrogels, lattice-oriented TPU), CAD-driven geometry design, prototyping for real-world testing, and delivery of a comprehensive design report spanning manufacturing/outsourcing, cost/timing, sustainability, and rated risk analysis. I have also led the design and prototyping of a custom-fit lower-limb orthotic for an individual with SATB2, applying human-centred design, iterative testing, and detailed engineering documentation.

<br />
In parallel, I have built strong experience in biomedical instrumentation and data-driven health applications, including the development of a PPG-based pulse oximeter (ranked top in the system demonstration) using Arduino and Python-based signal processing and GUI visualisation, and a machine learning model for heart attack risk prediction using feature engineering and performance evaluation across standard classification metrics. My honours research further extends into electrochemical biosensing, with a focus on myeloperoxidase (MPO) and clinically relevant assay translation.

<br />
I am also a confident public speaker, with experience presenting complex biomedical topics to academic and mixed technical audiences, including:
- Decoding the Influence of Force on Stem Cell Differentiation
- MPO Catalysis: Electrochemical Insights into Pseudohalogenation vs. Catalase-like Activity
- Injectable Microbead-Encapsulated PCL/Collagen Hydrogel + LIPUS to Treat Knee Osteoarthritis

<br />
I’m always open to academic discussions, industry collaboration, and opportunities in biomedical engineering, diagnostics, instrumentation, and health technology.

## Areas of Interest for Graduate Opportunities
I’m currently seeking an entry-level / graduate role. If any of the areas below align with your team’s work, I’d welcome the opportunity to connect.
- Biomedical instrumentation & sensors (data acquisition, calibration, troubleshooting)
- Hardware-focused medical device development (circuits, sensor integration, hands-on prototyping, debugging)
- Embedded systems prototyping (Arduino/MCU basics, interfacing, testing)
- Signal processing & data analysis (Python/MATLAB, feature extraction, validation)
- Design & prototyping workflow (CAD, iterative testing, documentation)
- Verification & validation (V&V) support (test plans, repeatability, reporting, basic stats)
- Quality, compliance & risk mindset (WHS, design controls, risk analysis, traceable reporting)
